Let be real: a purely Bash terminal UI library/framework is a bit silly.  The language is not suited for it.  In order to acheive desired results I am building clunky data structures that would be fast running native code in a more appropriate language.

So .. why?  This project was built as a fun thought experiment and to provide me with a framework for gaining a deeper understanding of Bash.
And I am entertained trying to make it do things that it was never intented to do.
